# Pi control-plane threat model

## Trust boundaries

1. **Loopback HTTP JSON → typed job request.** Browser, CLI, and model-mediated
   callers are untrusted until the registered job-kind decoder accepts the whole
   payload.
2. **Worker claim/heartbeat/result → current attempt.** A session or stale process
   can present an old worker identity or lease token after expiry/reassignment.
3. **Persisted SQLite rows → domain state.** Corruption, partial migration, or a
   newer schema can violate the discriminated-union invariants.
4. **Model output → job lifecycle.** A completion may describe work but cannot
   register a job kind, supply executable code, or authorize a transition.
5. **Dashboard/Telegram command → control transition.** Authentication identifies
   the caller; it does not itself grant cancellation, retry, repository, review,
   deployment, wallet, or approval authority.
6. **Typed executor job → Claude/Cursor process.** Repository identity, lane,
   model, task family, and limits are untrusted until an exact registered adapter
   builds argv and prompt from source-owned templates. No job field becomes a
   command, flag, endpoint, plugin, environment variable, or free-form prompt.
7. **Harness handoff → supervisor result.** Executor output is an untrusted claim
   until its version, task/repository/head identity, status, provenance, bounds,
   and independent verifier evidence match the live attempt.

## Assets

- The true job state, attempt count, schedule, and terminal outcome.
- Exclusive ownership of a live attempt.
- Existing classifier and project-tool authority boundaries.
- Bounded, non-sensitive audit history.
- Scheduler availability under malformed or excessive input.
- The user's local session and repository state, which a job payload must never be
  able to mutate directly.
- Subscription/API billing provenance and the capacity Pi reserves for its own
  classification, registry, Telegram, and final-gate work, kept separate from
  what job attempts may spend.
- The trusted source-fixed adapter templates and isolated worktree boundary.

## STRIDE controls

| Threat | Concrete abuse | Required control and test |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Spoofing | A stale worker completes a reassigned attempt. | Random per-attempt lease token, expiry, and compare-and-set terminal write; stale-token tests. |
| Tampering | A caller submits an unknown kind, arbitrary command, invalid profile, impossible timestamp, or jitter wider than its base. | Exact decoders, registered discriminated unions, safe arithmetic, bounded fields; untrusted enqueue tests. |
| Repudiation | A worker denies claiming, abandoning, retrying, or cancelling work. | Transactional Attempt rows and append-only bounded Events tied to worker and lease token. |
| Information disclosure | A payload, error, event, or dashboard response carries credentials or raw model/tool output. | Registered payload schemas, protected-path guards, bounded summaries, safe read models, and no arbitrary blobs. |
| Denial of service | Huge payloads, unbounded attempts, distant schedules, lease overflow, or event growth wedge the service. | Request/body/field limits, maximum attempts and delays, checked timestamp arithmetic, retention policy, busy timeout, and malformed-boundary tests. |
| Elevation of privilege | A loopback client or leased job runs shell, invokes a tool, selects force/yolo, adds a plugin/MCP, or treats model text as approval. | No executable payload kind; exact adapter/model/task allowlists; source-fixed argv; job lease is routing only; existing classifier and constrained tools re-check authority at action time. |

### Executor boundary (trust boundaries 6-7)

| Threat | Concrete abuse | Required control and test |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Spoofing | An API-backed or custom-endpoint process claims to be a subscription harness. | The handoff's `executorProvenance` field is an executor self-declaration, not proof. The launching supervisor must verify local harness identity/provenance before admission (a required control that lands with the supervisor, not the protocol), scrub API/provider endpoint variables at launch, and fail closed when provenance cannot be established. |
| Tampering | A job injects flags, paths, prompts, stale head SHAs, or a mismatched handoff. | Exact payload keys and enums, canonical repository/head-format checks, no free-form prompt/argv fields, versioned handoff decoder that requires the handoff's declared head to match the leased payload's head. Live source verification — resolving the declared head against the repository's actual ref, not just checking its form and self-consistency — is a required control that lands with the supervisor, not the protocol. |
| Information disclosure | Prompt, raw executor output, credentials, or protected files enter SQLite, events, logs, or the dashboard. | Store only bounded task identity and sanitized evidence references; protected-path exclusions; never persist prompt/reasoning/raw logs. |
| Denial of service | Expensive lanes, huge outputs, retries, or concurrent executors exhaust subscription/Pi capacity. | Bounded attempt counts, lease TTLs, and retry delays (`MAX_ATTEMPTS`, `MAX_LEASE_TTL_MS`, `MAX_RETRY_DELAY_MS` in job-runtime.ts) and a single global job-count admission cap (`MAX_JOBS` in sqlite-job-store.ts) shared across every job kind. Open risk, not yet controlled: lane selection carries no cost tier, and the shared job cap has no reservation or partition for Pi's own operational work — a flood of `harness.review` jobs can exhaust it and starve other scheduling. Lands with the supervisor, not the protocol. |

## First abuse-case tests

`job-runtime.test.ts` was run red before the runtime implementation. It covers:

- unknown executable job kinds and invalid review profiles;
- oversized idempotency keys and invalid recurrence jitter;
- early claims and invalid lease lifetimes;
- stale lease success/failure publication;
- first-writer-wins terminal transitions;
- cooperative cancellation for live attempts;
- retry/abandon behavior bounded by maximum attempts;
- refusal to reclaim an unexpired lease.

`harness-adapter.test.ts` and `harness-protocol.test.ts` were run red before the
harness adapter implementation. Together they prove rejection of unknown
lanes/models/task families, free-form prompt/command/environment fields,
relative or protected repository paths, malformed head identity (wrong length,
non-hex, or wrong case), API/custom endpoint/force/plugin/MCP flags, malformed
or oversized handoffs, and handoffs whose head, job id, attempt, repository,
lane, or verification status does not match the leased payload. They do not
prove rejection of a well-formed but stale head — the head is checked for
format and for self-consistency against the payload/handoff pair, not against
the repository's live ref (see the Tampering row above). The Cursor payload variant fixes
`task: "review-probe"` and `isolation: "read-only"`, so no mutating Cursor
payload is representable — Cursor mutation is ineligible by construction, not
merely rejected at runtime. Model output cannot select a lane or terminal
transition: only the registered decoders and the handoff-matching check drive
those transitions.

The SQLite adapter and HTTP server must add red tests for concurrent atomic claim,
duplicate idempotent enqueue, schema corruption/version drift, oversized bodies,
unknown routes/methods, non-loopback binding, event redaction, lease heartbeat and
expiry races, and service restart recovery before those boundaries are implemented.
