// The immutable half of the job contract from SPEC "Jobs and worker pools" and
// ADR 01: a job is a bounded execution request whose prompt, RESOLVED execution
// metadata, allowed tools, and allocated budget are frozen at submission so
// execution, recovery, and audit never re-derive them.
//
// Traceability to the current classified-workflows invocation surface this
// replaces (issue #32: "jobs carrying the existing invocation metadata"):
// - AgentRequest.task -> prompt (bounded for a durable record; workflows only
//   bounded it indirectly through the 100_000-character code envelope)
// - AgentRequest.tools -> allowedTools, but RESOLVED: the engine accepted a
//   comma-delimited string or left tools inherited; a preserved request names
//   a concrete non-empty set with the same per-name and per-set bounds
// - AgentRequest.model/thinking -> execution.model/execution.reasoning as
//   concrete values; "omit to inherit the session model" is a submitting-side
//   choice that must be resolved before the request is frozen
// - AgentRequest.cwd -> execution.cwd resolved to an absolute path
// - workflow tokenBudget/agentTimeoutMs/retries -> budget fields with the same
//   numeric bounds (MIN_CLASSIFIED_AGENT_TIMEOUT_MS, token envelope bounds)
// - workflow code, maxAgents, concurrency, workflowTimeoutMs, background, and
//   label stay OUT: the coordinating agent submits subsequent jobs itself,
//   concurrency belongs to pool dispatch, and labels are presentation
// - AgentRequest.schema (structured output) stays an execution-layer concern
//
// This module owns only the value contract. Admission and authority
// enforcement, persistence transactions, worker dispatch, shutdown handling,
// and SDK hosting are separate owners, and nothing here activates a pool.
